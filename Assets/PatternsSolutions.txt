A. You want to make an object fall and also set specific layers to collide the ground or fall
    1. Add the Fall.cs and create a FallSO
    2. add a feet collider and a body collider and set it on the serialize of the Fall.cs
    3. the ground layer in the SO corresponds the main layer that enables ongrounded this will not excluye or include any collision
    4. if you want to include or exclude layers go to feet or body and exclude or include the layers for the collision
    5. the layer of the object cant be the same as the ground layer setted in the SO, it will not work.


B. You want to create an object with an animator and physics and the sprite is resized or something like that or maybe you want to add a new component with specific script
    1. create a parent object, name it ex: MainObject.cs
    2. create a chill object named Sprite&SFX add here all the components for the animations and the sprite renderer
        2.1 create an AnimHandler class that will have public methods calling the animations or rendering options
        2.2 if needed add a reference of the MainObject.cs (ex: you want to destroy the object in a certain frame using animation events,
         you have to create the function inside AnimHandler to use it on the animator and you need the reference of the object to destroy it in the function)
    3. create a second object named feet & body 
        2.1 if collisions need a certain script to function, add to each object the necesarry script and reference the MainObject.cs if needed
         (dont over-referenece use only for specific mechanics, in some cases reference the colliders in the MainObject.cs via the inspector is just right) 
    Note: if you want to add a new child with a certain set of scripts and component just create a Handler.cs that communicates 
    the MainObject.cs and the new component keeping the logic or the connection to MainObject.cs of the new component in Handler.cs
     where here if you want you can reference the MainObject.cs and in MainObject.cs you can also reference the Handler.cs always keeping a good dependency 


C. Interact and interactor, this patterns basically needs 2 gameobjects that holds this references 
D. Remember, animator will always cancel script lerp and instead will constraint the default value of the object scale for that just use spritesheets.
